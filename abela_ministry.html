        <section id="hear">
            <h2>Hear the Gospel</h2>
            <p>Faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. (Romans 10:17)</p>
            <p>You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. (John 8:32)</p>
        </section>

        <section id="believe">
            <h2>Believe the Gospel</h2>
            <p>Without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. (Hebrews 11:6)</p>
            <p>But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. (John 20:31)</p>
        </section>

        <section id="repent">
            <h2>Repent of Past Sins</h2>
            <p>I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. (Luke 13:3)</p>
            <p>In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. (Acts 17:30)</p>
        </section>

        <section id="confess">
            <h2>Confess Faith in Jesus Christ</h2>
            <p>For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. (Romans 10:10)</p>
            <p>Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven. (Matthew 10:32)</p>
        </section>

        <section id="baptize">
            <h2>Be Baptized</h2>
            <p>For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. (Galatians 3:27)</p>
            <p>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. (Mark 16:16)</p>
            <p>Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." (Acts 2:38)</p>
        </section>

        <section id="faithful">
            <h2>Be Faithful Unto Death</h2>
            <p>Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor's crown. (Revelation 2:10)</p>
